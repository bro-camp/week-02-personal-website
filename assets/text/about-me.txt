Hi there, I'm Jeff Biju Jose, an experienced web developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web applications. My interest in web development started at school, where I took my first coding class and became fascinated by the way websites and applications were built.

Since then, I've honed my skills in front-end development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging and user-friendly interfaces. I'm also proficient in front-end frameworks like bootstrap.

Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects, from simple landing pages to large-scale enterprise applications. I pride myself on my attention to detail and my ability to collaborate effectively with designers, project managers, and other developers.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, attending web development conferences, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
